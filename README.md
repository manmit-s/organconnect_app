OrganConnect - Bridging Lives, One Donation at a Time
=====================================================

🚀 Project Overview
-------------------

OrganConnect is a Flutter-based mobile app crafted to transform organ donation in India by connecting donors, recipients, and hospitals seamlessly. Built for **BUILDATHON by TUTEDUDE**, our goal is to address the critical organ shortage crisis with a platform that's transparent, accessible, and user-friendly. Yeh app *ekdum zabardast* hai for saving lives!

Our demo features a clean, intuitive UI, setting the stage for a powerful solution. We're actively working on integrating a backend and database to make OrganConnect a reality that can scale and save lives.

💡 Problem Statement
--------------------

-   **Organ Shortage**: Thousands lose their lives waiting for organ transplants due to low awareness and inefficient systems.
-   **Lack of Trust**: Myths and lack of transparency discourage potential donors.
-   **No Centralized Platform**: There's no easy way to connect donors, recipients, and medical institutions in real-time.

OrganConnect tackles these challenges by simplifying the donation process, educating users, and building trust through technology. *Ab lives save karna hoga aur bhi aasaan!*

🌟 Features (Current & Planned)
-------------------------------

### Current Features (Demo)

-   **User-Friendly UI**: A minimal, Flutter-built interface for donors and recipients to navigate easily.
-   **Donor Registration**: Simple form to collect donor info (name, blood type, contact).
-   **Awareness Hub**: Info cards to educate users about organ donation and debunk myths.
-   **Cross-Platform**: Runs smoothly on both Android and iOS, thanks to Flutter. *Ek app, double dhamaka!*

### Future Scope

-   **Backend & Database**: Integrate Firebase or MongoDB for secure, real-time data management.
-   **Smart Matching**: Algorithm to pair donors with recipients based on blood type, location, and urgency.
-   **Hospital Portal**: Enable hospitals to manage transplant requests and verify donors.
-   **Push Notifications**: Notify users about urgent needs or donation campaigns.
-   **Blockchain Transparency**: Use blockchain to ensure tamper-proof donation records.
